# Circle colourer

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Make a `<form>` tag with an `<input>` inside it—use `type="color"` for the input.
- When the form’s `change` event fires, adjust the `background-color` of the ball to match the input’s value.
- *Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Optional challenges

*These challenges are here if you’d like to try a little more work—they are for extra experience and learning. They are completely optional and not graded. Show them to me if you’d like—I’d love to see them.*

1. Allow the user to add a new ball to the screen by clicking a button. Changing the colour will now affect that ball.
2. Allow the user to click on any ball, changing the focus, therefore the colour changes the focused ball.
